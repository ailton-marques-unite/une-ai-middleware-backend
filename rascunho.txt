based on application's architecture, good practices and dependenciy inversion, references documentation and @https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants, I need to create  endpoints to expose the services from Assistants (Domain). At first, we leave Squad, Calls, Chats, Campaigns, etc. for later.
It is important that properties, headers and parameters follow the typing rules of the original routes and it would also be ideal to create interfaces to validate payloads.
